        ## Please help us help you!

        Before filing your issue, ask yourself:
        - Is this clearly a Seamless Interaction dataset or utility function defect?
        - Do I have basic ideas about where it goes wrong? (For example, if there are stack traces, are they pointing to specific scripts or functions?)
        - Could it be because of my own setup, network issues, or incorrect usage?

        **The GitHub issue tracker is not a support forum**. If you are not sure whether it could be your mistake, ask in the [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/facebookresearch/seamless_interaction/discussions) first. The quickest way to verify whether it's a dataset/utility defect is through a **reproduction** with a minimal example.

        Make the bug obvious. Ideally, we should be able to understand it without running any code.

        Bugs are fixed faster if you include:
        - A minimal reproduction script
        - Specific file IDs or batch numbers that cause the issue
        - Complete error messages and stack traces
        - Your environment details (Python version, OS, etc.)

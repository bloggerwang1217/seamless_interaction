        This template is for documentation requests related to the Seamless Interaction dataset, including:

        - Documenting undocumented dataset features, utility functions, or APIs
        - Clarifying unclear instructions in the README or examples
        - Improving code examples and tutorials
        - Fixing broken or outdated links
        - Adding missing documentation for new dataset splits, formats, or features
        - Enhancing setup and installation guides

        If you followed the documentation but the code doesn't work, consider whether it's a documentation issue or a code bug. For code bugs, please use the "bug" template instead.

        We welcome documentation improvements! If your documentation request is:

        - Relevant to users of the Seamless Interaction dataset
        - About core dataset functionality, download methods, or data loading
        - Not already covered elsewhere in the documentation

        You may proceed directly to sending a pull request, and we can improve on your work.
        If you're not able to contribute yourself, this issue is still welcomed.
